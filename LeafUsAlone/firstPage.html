<h1>It is the year 2019 and Cut Down Trees & Co are attempting to cut down the tree of life. If they succeed then all of the trees on Earth are doomed, destroying the environment and everything else in the world. You must attempt to stop them from doing so.
Plant trees and build renewable energy sources to halt there insidious advance, stopping wave after wave of workers attempting to destroy the tree. Succeed and you will save the planet but fail and things will proceed as they are in real life (humanity and every other living being falling).
